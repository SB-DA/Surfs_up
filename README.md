# Surfs_up
Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, analyze and visualize climate data as you prepare to open a surf shop.

## Overview of the Analysis
While on vacation last year in Hawaii I discovered a newfound passion for surfing and was trying to come up with an idea or a plan that will not just let me return to Hawaii but live there forever. I finally came up with an idea that I thought was full proof - A surfing shake shop serving surfboards and Icecreams to locals and tourists.

I needed some real investors to back this plan. So I made a business plan and reached out to W. Avy who is famous for his board surfing. The first meeting went extremely well. But he was concerned about the weather. W.Avy had invested in a shake shop during his early career however, he didn't ask for any weather analysis and his venture rained out of existence.W. Avy knows I have been learning how to analyse data properly. So he has asked to run some analytics on weather dataset he has from the very Island where I would like to open the shop. 

## Challenge Overview
W. Avy likes the analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results
There are really only two seasons in Hawaii: summer (kau) from May to October and winter (hooilo) from November to April. The average daytime summer temperature at sea level is 85° F (29.4° C), while the average daytime winter temperature is 78° (25.6° C). 

Usually the southern side of Oahu, including Waikiki and Honolulu along with the southwest coast at Ko Olina recieve a lot of Hawaiian sunshine. 

- As per results below the average temperature in June is around 75° F. Maximum temperature near 85° F and Minimum around 64° F.
- Average temperature in December is around 71° F. Maximum around 83° F and lowest around 56° F.

## Summary
While it's always going to be close to impossible to predict exact future weather it’s helpful to look at Hawaiian weather analysis. And the weather looks almost favorable to go ahead and start a Shake shop. But before taking the big decision it's good to run a few more analysis.

- Analysing weather patterns to determine the occurrence of storm, hurricane, or cyclone.
- Going through the Surf forecast to check the high and low tides. This will help us to determine how favorable the ocean will be for surfing year-round.
