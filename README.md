# Surfs_up
Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, analyze and visualize climate data as you prepare to open a surf shop.

## Overview of the Analysis
While on vacation last year in Hawaii I discovered a newfound passion for surfing and was trying to come up with an idea or a plan that will not just let me return to Hawaii but live there forever. I finally came up with an idea that I thought was full proof - A surfing shake shop serving surfboards and Icecreams to locals and tourists.

I needed some real investors to back this plan. So I made a business plan and reached out to W. Avy who is famous for his board surfing. The first meeting went extremely well. But he was concerned about the weather. W.Avy had invested in a shake shop during his early career however, he didn't ask for any weather analysis and his venture rained out of existence.W. Avy knows I have been learning how to analyse data properly. So he has asked to run some analytics on weather dataset he has from the very Island where I would like to open the shop. 

## Challenge Overview
W. Avy likes the analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results
The climate of an area is a composite or frequency distribution of various kinds of weather. The outstanding features of Hawaii's climate include mild temperatures throughout the year, moderate humidity, persistence of northeasterly trade winds, significant differences in rainfall within short distances, and infrequent severe storms.
For most of Hawaii, there are only two seasons: "summer," between May and October, and "winter," between October and April.

- As per results below the average temperature in June is around 75. Maximum temperature near 85 and Minimum around 64.
- Average temperature in December is around 71. Maximum around 83 and lowest around 56
